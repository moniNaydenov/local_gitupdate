Description
-----------

The gitupdate plugin allows the moodle administrator to update git repositories using only the
web interface


Requirements
------------

The plugin is available for Moodle 3.6. It also requires "git" to be installed on the server. If 
the repositories require ssh connection and credentials, they need to be set up to the user which
runs the web server (apache,httpd,www-data,www..). All source-code files have to have write permissions
present to that user. 


Installation
------------

* Copy the module code directly to the local/gitupdate directory.

* Log into Moodle as administrator.

* Open the administration area (http://your-moodle-site/admin) to start the installation
  automatically.


Admin Settings
--------------

No administrator settings

Documentation
-------------

No documentation available. 
In order to use the plugin, open the Navigation drawer and click on "Open gitupdate".
